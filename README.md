FrozenLake Q-Learning with Pygame Visualization
This repository contains an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm applied to the FrozenLake environment from OpenAI's Gym library. The project includes a custom Pygame-based visualization to render the environment, the agent's movement, and the learning process in real-time.

Features
Q-Learning Algorithm: Implementation of Q-Learning with a Q-table, ε-greedy action selection, and ε-decay.

Custom FrozenLake Map: Randomly generates a 6x6 grid with a start point, goal, and traps. Ensures the map has a valid path from start to goal.

Pygame Visualization: Real-time rendering of the environment, agent's path, and score.

Interactive Testing: After training, the agent's performance can be visualized step-by-step.
