# FrozenLake Q-Learning Project

## Introduction
This is a project that uses the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the FrozenLake problem. It combines the  Gym environment with Pygame visualization to provide a real-time rendering of the agent's learning process and path.

## Features
- Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation
- Custom Map Generation
- Pygame Visualization
